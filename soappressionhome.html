                 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Justin Poplin and I edit funny little goofy videos in my free time!&nbsp;  I graduated top five of my class in high school, but after realising that I enjoyed working more than I enjoyed school, 
                    I opted to go to work.&nbsp;  I work at a meat packing plant and though my free time is a little limited I try my best to make the most of it.&nbsp;  I actually do a lot of stuff in my free time, I enjoy working 
                    on my truck, hanging out and shooting the breeze, and creating and editing videos.

                 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Soappression started after many years of bouncing between usernames and internet handles.&nbsp;  I was still running with the username "killsteeler12804" when I created the intagram account
                    "Bar O' Soap" back in 2017.&nbsp;  This instagram account was used to post daily pictures of soap and tell people to take a bath becuase they stunk.&nbsp;  I never used "Bar O' Soap" as a handle
                    until after 2022 when I really got back into recording and editing.&nbsp;  I started a youtube channel under the name in late 2022 and posted a few videos before it got leaked and a few too many
                    people from school found out about it.&nbsp;  Naturally, I unlisted every video and stepped away for a bit before I could get picked on too much becuase of it.&nbsp;  In 2024 I was once again
                    trying to rebrand and start uploading again, but couldn't settle on a name.&nbsp;  I rolled a few names around and settled on "Psycho Suppression" which I thought sounded pretty cool.&nbsp;  
                    The only issue I found was that the name was already taken and outside of spelling it wrong, there was no way to deal with that.&nbsp;  I ended up going through all my old accounts looking
                    for anything to base the name on and that's when it clicked "soap" "pression", "Soappression".&nbsp;  The name means absolutely nothing, but I like to tell people it means something different
                    everytime they ask.
