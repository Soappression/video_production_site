                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Justin Poplin and I edit funny little goofy videos in my free time!&nbsp;  I graduated top five of my class in high school, but after realising that I enjoyed working more than I enjoyed school, 
                I opted to go to work.&nbsp;  I work at a meat packing plant and though my free time is a little limited I try my best to make the most of it.&nbsp;  I actually do a lot of stuff in my free time, I enjoy working 
                on my truck, hanging out and shooting the breeze, and creating and editing videos.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Soappression started after many years of bouncing between usernames and internet handles.&nbsp;  I was still running with the username "killsteeler12804" when I created the intagram account
                    "Bar O' Soap" back in 2017.&nbsp;  This instagram account was used to post daily pictures of soap and tell people to take a bath becuase they stunk.&nbsp;  I never used "Bar O' Soap" as a handle
                    until after 2022 when I really got back into recording and editing.&nbsp;  I started a youtube channel under the name in late 2022 and posted a few videos before it got leaked and a few too many
                    people from school found out about it.&nbsp;  Naturally, I unlisted every video and stepped away for a bit before I could get picked on too much becuase of it.&nbsp;  In 2024 I was once again
                    trying to rebrand and start uploading again, but couldn't settle on a name.&nbsp;  I rolled a few names around and settled on "Psycho Suppression" which I thought sounded pretty cool.&nbsp;  
                    The only issue I found was that the name was already taken and outside of spelling it wrong, there was no way to deal with that.&nbsp;  I ended up going through all my old accounts looking
                    for anything to base the name on and that's when it clicked "soap" "pression", "Soappression".&nbsp;  The name means absolutely nothing, but I like to tell people it means something different
                    everytime they ask.

                   <p>This is my newest gaming project, Soappression.&nbsp;  This youtube channel houses montages, retrospectives, and anything else gaming related that I have made.&nbsp;  I've always wanted to upload my own gameplay in some form, always trying to replicate what I was interested in watching.&nbsp;  
                       It started out with a youtube channel with the handle, "killsteeler12804" my gamertag on Playstation, I uploaded minecraft lets plays, call of duty commentaries, you name it!&nbsp;  I went through many different
                       channels throught my life, trying to find a niche that suited me.&nbsp;  After growing up however, I found that I dont need a niche to create content, I just need to enjoy the content I'm making,
                       be that short films, gaming videos, or websites like this one.&nbsp;  So now I have Soappression, my latest attempt at posting gaming videos on the internet!

                   <p>My most recent upload on Soappression was this Call of Duty montage showing off the AEK Marksman Rifle with the full auto modification.&nbsp; I decided to put the little scene where I talk about 
                    the gun at the begining of the video instead of the end, there was no reason for this other than seeing if it flowed better.&nbsp;  The song I used as a backing track was modified just a little bit, I 
                    used Premiere's audio looping setting to run the track to length.&nbsp;  The song was really good until I did this, I felt like it got pretty repetative aftaer a minute or two.&nbsp;  I also tried a few
                    new things with the light leak transitions and flashing between actual gameplay and play of the game replays.&nbsp;  All and all I did enjoy the project even if it was just a little COD montage!&nbsp;  
                    I don't exactly intent on making more montages, but I have so much footage from BO6 from before I deleted it that I almost feel bad letting the footage go to waste, so who know!

                <p>Class Killer was my final production from Senior year of High School.&nbsp;  After a long drag with conflicting scheduals and "uncooperative" actors, the project finally came to be!&nbsp;  The script
                    was 21 pages long and though we did not stick to the script 100% it was still very true to the vision.&nbsp;  We pushed the limit with this project, becoming the longest film in class history, and pushing
                    the boundry of "school appropriate".&nbsp;  We included the big bad fuck word 33 entire times in this school film, and to make this even funnier when showing it during class I accidently uploaded the 
                    Director's Cut which had absolutely no censoring.

                <p>The production I currently have in the works is a little outside of my comfort zone, but I really loved the idea as soon as it came to me.&nbsp;  The concept is about how the world is supposed to
                    be this colorful magical place all throughout our lives, but due to different experiences and desires, it becomes this gloomy black and white world of boredom.&nbsp;  I plan on calling the piece, 
                    "Normality" and through it you will see the main character, a young man, struggles with losing his passions and becoming another "zombie" in this world that everyone tells him is normal.&nbsp;
                    The idea came to me as I was at work and talking to myself about adhd, anxiety, and autism.
